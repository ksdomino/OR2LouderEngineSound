# OR2LouderEngineSound
Quieter Sound Effects Pack to make for a louder Ferrari Engine Sound In Outrun 2 Pc

This release lowers the volume of the other sounds by 50% so the engine sounds louder. You'll still have to go into audio settings and  turn the music down (by upto 50%) to create a balance that you like and then turn up the overall volume on your headphones.

# NOTES:
- English only.
- It works on most (but not all) modes. I know it doesn't work on heart attack mode (because there were just too many sounds to edit (would take too long using the currently available tools and limited automation available).
- remember that this is more of a rebalance and you need to edit your settings to get the desired effect.

# INSTALLATION:

- BACKUP [your outrun installation folder]/SOUNDS FOLDER FIRST! I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU NOT LIKING THE RESULTS OF THIS FIX!! 
- Then copy the files from the zip into [your outrun installation folder]/SOUNDS, overwriting the existing files.
- Go into the in-game audio settings and  turn the music down (by upto 50%) to create a balance that you like and then turn up the overall volume on your headphones/speakers/etc.
