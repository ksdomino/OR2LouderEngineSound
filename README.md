# OR2LouderEngineSound

The best thing about Outrun is the Music! 
This mod fixes a bug in the original game where the road effects were too loud compared to the music and Ferrari engine. 
This release lowers the volume of the other sound Effects (especially the road effects) by 50% so the engine sounds louder. 
You'll still have he option to turn the music down or sound effects down to create a balance that you like and then turn up the overall volume on your headphones.

EDIT: This mod doesn't make it harder to hear Outrun's amazing music, it actually make it clearer because it fixes a problem in the original release where all road effects are stored in the same .pak file as the engine making everything the same volume! This mod fixes that oversight.

# NOTES:
- English only.
- It works on most (but not all) modes. I know it doesn't work on heart attack mode (because there were just too many sounds to edit (would take too long using the currently available tools and limited automation available).
- remember that this is more of a rebalance and you need to edit your settings to get the desired effect.

# INSTALLATION:

- BACKUP [your outrun installation folder]/SOUNDS FOLDER FIRST! I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU NOT LIKING THE RESULTS OF THIS FIX!! 
- Then copy the files from the zip into [your outrun installation folder]/SOUNDS, overwriting the existing files.
- Go into the in-game audio settings and p lay with the settings to create a balance that you like and then turn up the overall volume on your headphones/speakers/etc and enjoy!
