Quieter Sound Effects Pack to make for a louder Ferrari Engine Sound In Outrun 2 Pc

### What I can do
I can import the files into audition as raw audio and I know how to make the changes. I can also export the files as raw audio but this breaks the file if I make any changes. 

### Problem

The .pak files seem to contain more than just raw audio. They need to be properly unpacked so that only the audio portion can edited and put back into the .PAK so Outrun 2 won't crash when it loads the file.
